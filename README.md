# Autonomous Delivery Agent

## 📦 Project Overview

This project implements an autonomous delivery agent capable of navigating a 2D grid city to deliver packages efficiently. The agent employs various pathfinding algorithms to handle both static and dynamic obstacles, ensuring optimal delivery routes.

---

## 🧠 Features

* **Rational Agent Design**: The agent selects actions that maximize delivery efficiency.
* **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Utilizes algorithms to navigate the environment effectively.
* **Dynamic Obstacle Handling**: Adapts to moving obstacles in the delivery path.
* **Modular Code Structure**: Organized into separate Python files for clarity and maintainability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. It's recommended to create a virtual environment for this project.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saksham110206/autonomous-delivery-agent-final.git
   cd autonomous-delivery-agent-final
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Simulation

To start the simulation, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will initiate the agent's delivery process within the predefined environment.
